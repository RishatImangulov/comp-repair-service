## Questions sections:

1. how I can save unique number of ticket, but every year start from 0001?
2. should commit be corresponded between front and back - or it is necessary only for major version commits?
3. what I should do with that:
   ```
   git config --global core.autocrlf true: Converts LF to CRLF on checkout, and CRLF to LF on commit.
   git config --global core.autocrlf false: No conversion.
   git config --global core.autocrlf input: Converts CRLF to LF on commit, but leaves LF as LF.
   ```
4. how I can hide db credentials in compose and in yaml? env file or docker secret file or something else? 
5. phone of person - String or Long? Or new Object like {type: mobile, number: 8-999-1234567, preferred - whatsapp text}
6. am I did it right - about DTO and Mapper for Person ? Can mapper have repository field - or i shouldn't put business logic in mapper? 
7. how i can maintain uniqueness name of person ? in sql or in service. or both? 
8. dto and mappers for advertising and clientStatus are too much? can i develop Starter for this simple cases?
9. why number of id increase even when i got 500 error - because there are duplicates ? or it is not a problem?
