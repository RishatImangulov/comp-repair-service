## Questions sections:

1. how I can save unique number of ticket, but every year start from 0001?
2. should commit be corresponded between front and back - or it is necessary only for major version commits?
3. what I should do with that:
   ```
   git config --global core.autocrlf true: Converts LF to CRLF on checkout, and CRLF to LF on commit.
   git config --global core.autocrlf false: No conversion.
   git config --global core.autocrlf input: Converts CRLF to LF on commit, but leaves LF as LF.
   ```
